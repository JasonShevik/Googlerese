# Googlerese
I wrote this program in 2012 when I was 16 years old for the "Google Code Jam 2012" qualifying round's Problem A "Speaking in Tongues". 
I successfully beat that problem, but I seem to remember that I never attempted the other ones because they looked harder and I figured they wouldn't give a 16 year old a job anyway.

The problem is described here: https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/1460488/dashboard
The problem gave users 3 lines of plaintext, and their coresponding ciphertexts.
I simply mapped the given characters to their corresponding outputs and hardcoded the solution into the program in a large switch structure.
